Where will you go when it's over?
Who will you know when it's over?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you
Where will you go when it's over?
Do you get lost on your own?
And I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you
Late night, zip ties
Make you wanna miss your flight
Flippin' through your feelings like a Gemini
I'm staring at your dark side
So far, so gone
Standin' with a white dress on
Only say you need me when your friends gone home
And tryna get your mind right
But if I only get one life, this is what I wanna do
And if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
And if I only have one night, yeah, I'd spend it with you
So if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
I'm gonna live it with you
Say something like
It's only you
It's only you
New wave, riptide
Hopin' I can change your life
If you need a second chance, you can take mine
See you in a new light (see you in a new)
Skintight, cocaine
You don't wanna feel this way
You know I'd do anything to make you stay
I'm pullin' all my best lines
But if I only get one life, this is what I wanna do
And if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
And if I only have one night, yeah, I'd spend it with you
So if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
Say something like
It's only you
It's only you
Say something like
It's only you
It's only you
Where will you go when it's over?
Who will you know when it's over?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you
