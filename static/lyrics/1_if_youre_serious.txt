This is your life
And I won't try to read your mind
But the way your hand fits into mine
I won't second-guess, it's a sign
And if you're serious
Then I'll give you the illusion of feeling love
I'll change your point of view 'til you feel enough
You just gotta choose if you're serious
Give it some time
And I'll try to remember my lines
Watch the way your plans turn into mine
To match the photo that's stuck in my mind
And if you're serious
Then I'll give you the illusion of feeling love
I'll change your point of view 'til you feel enough
You just gotta choose if you're serious
You just gotta choose if you're serious
If this is your life
Then all that matters lives in your mind
And the truth is up for you to define
I hope that you choose to be mine
And if you're serious
Then I'll give you the illusion of feeling love
I'll change your point of view 'til you feel enough
You just gotta choose if you're serious
You just gotta choose if you're serious
You just gotta choose if you're serious
(And if you're serious)
(And if you're serious)
You just gotta choose if you're serious
(And if you're serious)
(And if you're serious)
You just gotta choose if you're serious
