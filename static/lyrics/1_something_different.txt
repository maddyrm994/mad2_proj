You always say what's on your mind
And dance like nobody's around you
Someone like you, so hard to find
I can't believe I even found you
I'm tryna do this every FaceTime
You know that you had me from the first line
I could listen to a story from you ten times
There's nothing I would clarify
There's some' different 'bout you
Some' different, some' different
There's some' different 'bout you
Some' different, some' different
Need your voice on repeat, all that good energy
All of the aura you bring
There's some' different 'bout you
Some' different, some' different
You're never one to criticize
Even if somebody doubts you
You're always down to stay all night
You watch The Crown like its about you
And every time you wanna FaceTime
You know that you had me from the first line
I could listen to a story from you ten times
There's nothing I would clarify
There's some' different 'bout you
There's some' different 'bout you
Some' different, some' different
Need your voice on repeat, all that good energy
All of the aura you bring
There's some' different 'bout you
Some' different, some' different
I try to do this every night
When I call you 'cause I need to hear your voice
I was running 'til I fell into your void
Now there's nothing that can change my mind
There's some' different 'bout you
There's some' different 'bout you
Some' different, some' different
Need your voice on repeat, all that good energy
All of the aura you bring
There's some' different 'bout you
Some' different, some' different
